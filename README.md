# covid-data-analytics-jupyter-notebook
I attempted some predictive analytics using various data back in June. Still incomplete, nover got to the "preddictive" part, hard to find a pattern and reliable data or find a way to use different data sets without comparing apples to oranges since the testing policy ets if differnt for each place. etc. etc.

Only See: Untitled.ipynb (scroll past the first few code blocks.)
